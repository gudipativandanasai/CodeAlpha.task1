## 🤖 Chatbot Scope

### 📘 Overview
The *Chatbot Scope* project explores the design of an interactive text-based chatbot. It uses simple rule-based or keyword-based logic to simulate intelligent responses and can later be enhanced with NLP and AI capabilities.

### ⚙ Features
- Text-based input and output interface  
- Keyword and intent-based responses  
- Easily customizable conversation flow  
- Modular codebase for scalability  

### 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Optionally: NLTK / spaCy for NLP tasks  
- Flask (for optional web deployment)  

### 🌱 Future Enhancements
- Integration with ML models (GPT-style text generation)  
- Context-aware conversation handling  
- Voice input/output adaptation
